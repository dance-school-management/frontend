# Dance School Management - Web

## How to run

First of all, you will need `pnpm` installed and you will need to have a `.env` file in directory `apps/web` - `.env.example` is a good example.

Then run the following commands to open the development server:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run dev
```

If you want production build, run the following commands:

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm run start
```
